## python_GuessNumber
This is a short program I wrote on my own to practice Python. I decided to see if I could make a program that would basically do the same thing as the JavaScript program I wrote like this. I initially had a similar problem where a false negative was returned when I guessed the correct number, but found that by converting the randomint to a string it would then match the input value of the guess variable. I plan to keep expanding this game to practice and improve my Python.
